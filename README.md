To-Do List Application
A simple,<br> user-friendly To-Do List Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is designed to help users organize and track their tasks efficiently.
The To-Do List Application allows users to:
    Add new tasks to the list.
    Mark tasks as complete.
    Delete tasks when no longer needed.
Features:
    Add Tasks: Enter a task in the input field and click "Add Task" or press Enter to add it to the list.
    Mark as Complete: Click the "Complete" button to toggle the completed status of a task (adds a strike-through style).
    Delete Tasks: Click the "Delete" button to remove a task from the list.
    Persist Data: The application uses localStorage to save tasks so they persist after the page is refreshed (optional feature).
Technologies Used:
    HTML: For structuring the web page.
    CSS: For styling the application and improving the user experience.
    JavaScript: For handling dynamic behavior such as adding, marking, and deleting tasks.
    LocalStorage: For saving task data locally in the browser.
